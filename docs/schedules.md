# Schedules

Some AI tasks work best on autopilot. Daily journaling prompts, weekly report generation, monthly summaries—tasks you want to happen consistently without remembering to trigger them. Schedules let you automate recurring AI interactions that run on a timer.

## What is a Schedule?

A schedule is an automated task that runs at specified intervals. When a schedule triggers, Osaurus sends your configured prompt to an agent and saves the response. You can review results later or set up notifications.

Each schedule includes:

- **Name** — Identifier for the scheduled task
- **Frequency** — When and how often to run
- **Agent** — Which AI assistant handles the task
- **Instructions** — The prompt sent when the schedule runs
- **Results** — Access to the last run's conversation

## Features

- **Flexible Frequency** — Once, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly execution
- **Agent Integration** — Assign an agent to handle scheduled tasks
- **Custom Instructions** — Define prompts sent to the AI when the schedule runs
- **Manual Trigger** — Run any schedule immediately with "Run Now"
- **Results Tracking** — View the chat session from the last run

## Accessing Schedules

Open the Management window with **⌘⇧M**, then navigate to the **Schedules** tab.

## Creating a Schedule

1. Open Management window (**⌘⇧M**) → **Schedules**
2. Click **Create Schedule**
3. Configure the schedule settings:
   - **Name** — Give your schedule a descriptive name
   - **Frequency** — Select how often to run
   - **Time** — Choose when to run (for recurring schedules)
   - **Agent** — Select which agent handles the task
   - **Instructions** — Write the prompt to send
4. Click **Save**

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**     | Hour and minute to run (24-hour format)         |
| **Day**      | Day of week (weekly) or day of month (monthly)  |
| **Date**     | Specific date (once or yearly)                  |

:::tip Timing
Schedules run when Osaurus is active. If your Mac is asleep or Osaurus isn't running at the scheduled time, the task runs when you next launch the app.
:::

### Agent Selection

Assign an agent to handle the scheduled task:

1. Select an agent from the dropdown
2. The agent's system prompt and tool configuration apply to the scheduled run
3. Different schedules can use different agents

**Example configurations:**

- **Daily Journal** — Use a reflective, conversational agent
- **Code Summary** — Use a technical agent with git tool access
- **Research Digest** — Use a research-focused agent with web search

### Instructions

Write the prompt that's sent when the schedule triggers:

**Example for daily journaling:**

```
Good morning! Let's start the day with a brief reflection.

Please ask me:
1. What are my top 3 priorities for today?
2. Is there anything from yesterday I need to follow up on?
3. What's one thing I'm looking forward to?

Keep the conversation warm and encouraging.
```

**Example for weekly reports:**

```
Generate a weekly summary based on our conversations from the past week.

Include:
- Key topics discussed
- Decisions made
- Action items identified
- Questions that remain open

Format as a concise bullet-point summary.
```

## Schedules with Agents

Schedules work seamlessly with [Agents](/agents):

- Each schedule can use a different agent
- The agent's system prompt shapes how instructions are interpreted
- Tool access is controlled by the agent's configuration

**Tip:** Create dedicated agents for scheduled tasks with appropriate tool access and personality.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start simple** — Begin with one or two schedules and add more as needed
2. **Use descriptive names** — Make it easy to identify schedules at a glance
3. **Match agent to task** — Choose an agent with appropriate tools and style
4. **Be specific in instructions** — Clear prompts yield better results
5. **Review results regularly** — Check that schedules are producing useful output
6. **Adjust timing** — Find times that work with your routine
7. **Use "Run Now" to test** — Verify new schedules work before waiting for the timer

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule Didn't Run

- **Check if Osaurus was running** — Schedules require the app to be active
- **Verify the schedule is enabled** — Paused schedules don't run
- **Check the time settings** — Ensure the scheduled time has passed

### Unexpected Results

- **Review the instructions** — Ambiguous prompts lead to inconsistent results
- **Check the agent** — Ensure the right agent is assigned
- **Look at tool access** — The agent may need specific tools enabled

### Missed Schedules

If Osaurus wasn't running at the scheduled time:

- The schedule runs on next app launch (if configured for catch-up)
- Or waits until the next scheduled time
- Use "Run Now" to trigger manually
