# Work Mode

Some tasks are too complex for a single prompt. Organizing thousands of files into folders, conducting deep research across multiple sources, building a feature across a codebase—these require planning, iteration, and persistence. Work Mode lets you hand off complex work to AI that can break it down, execute it step by step, and keep working even when you close the window.

## What is Work Mode?

Work Mode is an autonomous AI mode that executes multi-step tasks with built-in planning and issue tracking. Unlike regular chat (which responds to one message at a time), Work Mode can:

- Break down complex requests into trackable issues
- Generate execution plans with up to 10 steps per issue
- Perform file operations (read, write, edit, search, organize)
- Use tools to browse the web, search online, and automate your Mac
- Leverage skills for specialized methodologies
- Ask for clarification when tasks are ambiguous
- Continue working in the background

Think of Work Mode as a capable assistant you can delegate tasks to. You describe what you want, it creates a plan, and then executes that plan while you focus on other work.

## Features

### Issue Tracking

Every Work Mode task is organized into issues with clear status tracking:

| Status          | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Open**        | Task is queued and waiting to be worked on       |
| **In Progress** | AI is actively working on this task              |
| **Blocked**     | Task is waiting on a dependency or clarification |
| **Completed**   | Task finished successfully                       |
| **Cancelled**   | Task was stopped by the user                     |

Each issue can have:

- **Priority** — High, Medium, or Low
- **Dependencies** — Issues that must complete first
- **Description** — Detailed explanation of what needs to be done
- **Plan** — AI-generated steps to complete the task

### Parallel Tasks

Run multiple Work Mode tasks simultaneously for increased productivity. While one task organizes your photo library, another can be researching vacation destinations. Or while one refactors code, another writes documentation.

- Each task runs independently
- Progress is tracked separately
- Results are collected when all tasks complete

### Execution Planning

When you create a task, Work Mode generates a step-by-step plan before executing:

1. **Analysis** — Examines the request and working directory
2. **Planning** — Creates up to 10 concrete steps
3. **Review** — You can approve, modify, or reject the plan
4. **Execution** — Works through each step

Plans are transparent—you always see what Work Mode intends to do before it does it.

### Working Directory

Select a folder for Work Mode to operate in:

- **Folder Detection** — Automatically recognizes folder structure and file types
- **Scoped Operations** — File operations are limited to the selected directory
- **Context Awareness** — Understands folder organization and naming conventions

To set a working directory:

1. Open Work Mode in the Chat window
2. Click **Select Folder** or drag a folder onto the window
3. Work Mode now has context about your files

### File Operations

Work Mode can interact with your filesystem to complete tasks:

| Operation  | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read**   | View file contents to understand what's there     |
| **Write**  | Create new files (documents, notes, summaries)    |
| **Edit**   | Modify existing files with precise changes        |
| **Search** | Find files and content matching patterns          |
| **Move**   | Organize files into folders                       |
| **Rename** | Batch rename files with consistent naming schemes |

All file operations support **undo**—if something goes wrong, you can revert changes.

### Discovery

Work Mode automatically scans your folder to find:

- **File Types** — Documents, images, spreadsheets, code, and more
- **Patterns** — Naming conventions, folder structure, duplicates
- **Content** — Keywords, dates, topics within files
- **Issues** — Missing files, broken links, incomplete items

This discovery phase helps Work Mode understand what you have and plan accordingly.

### Clarification

When a task is ambiguous, Work Mode pauses to ask questions rather than guessing:

- "Should I organize photos by date or by event name?"
- "I found 50 duplicate files. Should I move them to a 'Duplicates' folder or delete them?"
- "The research has multiple angles. Should I focus on cost comparison or feature comparison?"

You can respond to clarification requests, and Work Mode continues with the updated context.

### Background Execution

Tasks continue running after you close the Work Mode window:

- Close the window and work on other things
- Return later to check progress
- Get notified when tasks complete (if notifications are enabled)

Long-running tasks don't require you to keep the window open.

### Tools Integration

Work Mode has access to all your installed [tools](/tools), enabling capabilities beyond file operations:

| Tool Category  | What Work Mode Can Do                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Browser**    | Navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, extract data |
| **Web Search** | Search the internet, find articles, gather information        |
| **Git**        | Check status, view history, create commits                    |
| **System**     | Interact with macOS, run scripts, automate workflows          |

Tools extend what Work Mode can accomplish—from researching topics online to automating repetitive Mac tasks.

### Skills Integration

Work Mode can leverage your enabled [skills](/skills) for specialized methodologies:

- **Research Analyst** — Structured approach to gathering and evaluating information
- **Debug Assistant** — Systematic debugging methodology
- **Code Reviewer** — Thorough code review with best practices
- **Custom Skills** — Any skills you've created or imported

Skills give Work Mode domain expertise, making it more effective at specialized tasks.
