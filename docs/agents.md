# Agents

One AI doesn't fit all. When you're writing code, you want a focused technical assistant. When you're brainstorming, you want creativity. When you're researching, you want access to the web.

Agents let you create specialized AI assistants for different tasks—each with its own personality, tools, and visual style. Switch between them instantly.

## What is an Agent?

An agent is a saved configuration that defines how your AI assistant behaves. Each agent can have:

- **Custom System Prompt** — Define unique instructions and personality
- **Tool Configuration** — Enable or disable specific tools per agent
- **Visual Theme** — Assign a custom theme that activates with the agent
- **Model & Generation Settings** — Set default model, temperature, and max tokens
- **Import/Export** — Share agents as JSON files

## Accessing Agents

Open the Management window with **⌘⇧M**, then navigate to the **Agents** tab.

## Creating an Agent

1. Open the Management window (**⌘⇧M**)
2. Select **Agents** from the sidebar
3. Click **Create Agent**
4. Configure the agent settings (see below)
5. Click **Save**

## Agent Settings

### Name and Description

| Setting         | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Name**        | Display name for the agent               |
| **Description** | Brief description of the agent's purpose |

### System Prompt

The system prompt defines the agent's personality and behavior. This is sent as the first message in every conversation.

**Example for a Code Assistant:**

```
You are an expert software engineer. You write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. When asked to write code, you:
- Follow best practices and design patterns
- Include helpful comments
- Consider edge cases
- Suggest improvements when appropriate
```

**Example for a Creative Writer:**

```
You are a creative writing assistant with a flair for vivid descriptions and engaging narratives. You help users craft compelling stories, poems, and creative content. Your writing style is expressive and imaginative.
```

### Model Settings

Configure the default model behavior for this agent:

| Setting         | Description                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**       | Default model to use (e.g., `llama-3.2-3b-instruct-4bit`) |
| **Temperature** | Controls randomness (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative) |
| **Max Tokens**  | Maximum length of generated responses                     |

**Tips:**

- Use lower temperature (0.1–0.3) for code and factual tasks
- Use higher temperature (0.7–0.9) for creative writing
- Adjust max tokens based on expected response length

### Tool Configuration

Enable or disable specific tools for each agent. This lets you create focused assistants:

| Tool State   | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Enabled**  | Tool is available for the agent to use |
| **Disabled** | Tool is hidden from the agent          |

**Example configurations:**

- **Code Assistant** — Enable `osaurus.git`, `osaurus.filesystem`; disable `osaurus.search`
- **Research Helper** — Enable `osaurus.search`, `osaurus.fetch`; disable `osaurus.filesystem`
- **Pure Chat** — Disable all tools for distraction-free conversation

### Visual Theme

Assign a custom theme that activates automatically when you switch to this agent. Each agent can have its own color scheme, creating a visual distinction between different assistants.

## Example Agents

{
  "name": "Code Assistant",
  "description": "Expert programming assistant",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert software engineer...",
  "model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct-4bit",
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "maxTokens": 2048,
  "enabledTools": ["osaurus.filesystem", "osaurus.git"],
  "theme": "dark-blue"
}
```

## Agents with Multi-Window

Agents work seamlessly with [Multi-Window Chat](/multi-window):

- Each window can have a different active agent
- Run multiple agents simultaneously (e.g., Code Assistant in one window, Research Helper in another)
- Right-click a session to open it in a new window with its original agent

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with templates** — Begin with the example agents and customize them
2. **Be specific in system prompts** — Detailed instructions yield better results
3. **Match temperature to task** — Low for precision, high for creativity
4. **Limit tools thoughtfully** — Fewer tools can mean more focused responses
5. **Use themes for context** — Visual distinction helps you stay oriented
6. **Export regularly** — Back up your custom agents
