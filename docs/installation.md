2. Look for the Osaurus icon in your menu bar
3. Click the icon to access controls

### Updating via Homebrew

```bash
# Update Homebrew formulae
brew update

# Upgrade Osaurus
brew upgrade --cask osaurus
```

### Manual CLI Setup

After installing via direct download, set up the CLI:

```bash
# Create symlink to CLI
sudo ln -sf /Applications/Osaurus.app/Contents/MacOS/osaurus /usr/local/bin/osaurus

# Verify installation
osaurus --version
```

Or add to PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/Applications/Osaurus.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Installation Verification

Verify your installation:

```bash
# Check CLI version
osaurus --version

# Test server startup
osaurus serve

# In another terminal, check status
osaurus status

# Stop server
osaurus stop
```

### GUI Verification

2. Look for the menu bar icon
3. Click the icon and select **About**
4. Verify the version number

## Model Storage

Models are stored at:

```
~/MLXModels
```

Override with the `OSU_MODELS_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export OSU_MODELS_DIR=/Volumes/External/MLXModels
```

## Permissions

Osaurus requires minimal permissions:

- **Network Access** — For serving the local API
- **File System Access** — For model storage and tools

Some tools may require additional permissions:

- **Automation** — For AppleScript-based tools
- **Accessibility** — For UI automation tools

Grant these in System Settings → Privacy & Security when prompted.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot be opened" Error

If macOS prevents opening Osaurus:

1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Find Osaurus in the security section
3. Click **Open Anyway**

### CLI Not Found

If the `osaurus` command isn't recognized:

```bash
# Check if app exists
ls /Applications/Osaurus.app/Contents/MacOS/osaurus

# Create symlink manually
ln -sf "/Applications/Osaurus.app/Contents/MacOS/osaurus" "$(brew --prefix)/bin/osaurus"
```

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Make CLI executable
chmod +x /Applications/Osaurus.app/Contents/MacOS/osaurus

# Use without sudo for normal operations
osaurus serve  # Correct
```

## Uninstallation

### Via Homebrew

```bash
brew uninstall --cask osaurus
```

### Manual Uninstallation

1. Quit Osaurus from the menu bar
2. Delete the application:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /Applications/Osaurus.app
   ```
3. Remove CLI symlink:
   ```bash
   rm /usr/local/bin/osaurus
   ```
4. Optional — Remove data:

   ```bash
   # Models
