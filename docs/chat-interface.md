# Chat Interface

Osaurus includes a beautiful glass-styled chat overlay that you can access from anywhere on your Mac. No browser tabs, no context switching—just press a hotkey and start talking to AI.

## Opening Chat

Press **⌘;** (Command + Semicolon) anywhere on your Mac to open the chat overlay. The overlay appears above your current work, so you can ask questions without losing your place.

Press **⌘;** again to close it, or click outside the overlay.

:::tip
You can customize the global hotkey in Settings if ⌘; conflicts with another app.

## Having a Conversation

Once the chat is open:

1. Type your message in the input field at the bottom
2. Press **Enter** to send
3. Watch the response stream in real-time
4. Continue the conversation as long as you like

The AI remembers your conversation history within the session, so you can ask follow-up questions naturally.

## Session History

Osaurus automatically saves your chat sessions, so you never lose a conversation.

### Viewing History

Click the **history icon** in the chat header to view your past conversations. Sessions are organized by date and display a preview of the conversation topic.

### Session Features

- **Persistent storage** — Conversations are saved automatically and persist across app restarts
- **Context tracking** — The AI maintains context within each session for natural follow-up questions
- **Quick resume** — Click any session to continue where you left off
- **Open in new window** — Right-click a session to open it in a separate window

### Managing Sessions

- **Search** — Filter sessions by keyword or date
- **Delete** — Remove individual sessions you no longer need
- **Clear all** — Start fresh by clearing your entire history

## Chat Features

### Markdown Rendering

Responses are rendered with full Markdown support:

- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Headers, lists, and tables**

### Copying Messages

Hover over any message to reveal the copy button. Click it to copy the message content to your clipboard—useful for grabbing code snippets or saving responses.

### Stop Generation

If a response is taking too long or going in the wrong direction, click the **Stop** button to interrupt generation. You can then refine your question and try again.

### Model Selection

Use the model dropdown at the top of the chat to switch between:

- **Local models** you've downloaded
- **Cloud providers** you've configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Apple Foundation Model** on macOS 26+

The selected model persists across sessions.
