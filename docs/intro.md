## Why Osaurus?

You chose macOS because you care about craft. You deserve AI tools built with the same philosophy—software that feels intentional, fast, and native. Not another Electron wrapper. Not a window into someone else's server that you're renting access to.

Inference is commoditizing—it's becoming cheap and abundant. The valuable layer is **continuity**: context, memory, personalization that compounds over time. That layer should belong to you, not a platform.

Osaurus puts you in control. Run AI models directly on your Mac with complete privacy, connect to cloud providers when you need more power, and switch between them freely. Your context stays with you.

### Our Beliefs

- **Local-first, not local-only** — Your machine is the source of truth. Run models locally for privacy and speed. Reach out to cloud providers when you need more power. The choice is always yours.

- **Context is yours** — The layer that makes AI personal—your preferences, patterns, history—should be portable and private. Switch providers without losing what the AI has learned about you.

- **AI as amplification** — The goal is not to replace human agency, but to amplify it. AI absorbs cognitive overhead—tedium, complexity, context-switching—so your attention goes where it matters.

- **The network is optional** — Your AI tools should work on an airplane, in a coffee shop with unreliable WiFi, or simply when you don't want to depend on someone else's infrastructure.

- **Free as in freedom** — Osaurus is open source, MIT licensed. Some things should exist as public goods. This is one of them.

## What Osaurus Does

Osaurus is native AI infrastructure for macOS—**local-first, privacy-respecting, provider-agnostic**. Not a single app that tries to do everything, but a foundation where focused capabilities compound when composed.

- **Run AI locally** — Download models and run them entirely on your Mac. No internet required, no data leaves your device.
- **Connect to any provider** — Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or OpenRouter when you need cloud capabilities. Switch freely.
- **Chat from anywhere** — Press ⌘; to open a beautiful chat overlay. No browser needed.
- **Extend with tools** — Give AI access to your filesystem, browser, git repos, and more through native plugins.
- **Build an ecosystem** — Skills, personas, schedules, and tools that work together—discovered, installed, and composed based on what you need.

Built for Apple Silicon. 10MB. Pure Swift. Instant startup.

## For Everyone

Whether you're a writer, researcher, student, or just curious about AI—Osaurus makes it easy to get started without any technical setup.

### Chat Interface

Press **⌘;** anywhere on your Mac to open a glass-styled chat overlay. Ask questions, get help with writing, brainstorm ideas. Press the hotkey again to dismiss. No browser tabs, no context switching—just you and your AI assistant.

[Learn more about the chat interface →](/chat-interface)

### Personas

Create custom AI assistants tailored to different tasks. A Code Assistant with access to your files. A Research Helper that can search the web. A Creative Writer with higher creativity settings. Each persona remembers its own personality, tools, and visual theme.

[Learn more about personas →](/personas)

### Skills

Extend your AI with reusable capabilities. Import skills from GitHub repositories or local files—research methodologies, debugging frameworks, creative techniques. Skills add domain expertise that works with any persona, and only load when you need them.

[Learn more about skills →](/skills)

### Schedules

Automate recurring AI tasks. Set up daily journal prompts, weekly report generation, or monthly goal reviews. Schedules run on a timer with your chosen persona, so helpful routines happen without you remembering to trigger them.

[Learn more about schedules →](/schedules)

### Agents

Execute complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. Organize files, conduct deep research across the web, automate repetitive workflows, or build features across a codebase. Agents use your installed tools and skills, breaking down requests into trackable issues and working through them step by step—even in the background.

### Voice Input

Speak naturally and watch your words appear in real-time. Powered by WhisperKit, all transcription happens on your device—completely private, works offline. Enable VAD Mode to activate your assistant hands-free with a wake phrase.

### Multi-Window

Work with multiple independent chat windows, each with its own persona and conversation. Run a Code Assistant in one window while researching in another. Pin important conversations to stay on top.

## For Developers

Osaurus provides the infrastructure for building AI-powered applications on macOS.

### OpenAI-Compatible API

Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. Use existing SDKs and tools—Python, JavaScript, LangChain, or any OpenAI-compatible client—without changing your code.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "llama-3.2-3b-instruct-4bit", "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

[View API reference →](/api)

### MCP Server

Osaurus is a full [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Connect it to Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP client to give AI access to your installed tools.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osaurus": {
      "command": "osaurus",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Native Tools

Tools built in Swift and Rust—not Python scripts. This means instant startup (under 10ms vs 200ms+), lower memory usage, and true multi-threaded performance. Official tools include browser automation, filesystem access, git operations, and web search.

| Aspect       | Python MCPs                 | Native Swift Tools    |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Startup      | ~200ms (venv + interpreter) | Under 10ms            |
| Memory       | Higher baseline + GC pauses | Precise ARC control   |
| Dependencies | Requires Python runtime     | Self-contained binary |

### Smart Context Management

Most AI tools load everything upfront—all skills, all tool definitions—burning thousands of tokens before you even ask a question. Osaurus uses **two-phase capability selection** instead.

The AI sees a lightweight catalog first (names and descriptions), then loads full definitions only for what it actually needs. This saves **~80% of context space**, leaving more room for your conversation and better reasoning.

| Approach    | Context Cost  | What Happens                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Traditional | ~5,000 tokens | All capabilities loaded upfront |
| **Osaurus** | ~1,000 tokens | Catalog first, load on demand   |

This means you can have dozens of skills and tools available without paying the cost until they're used.

### Apple Foundation Models

On macOS 26 (Tahoe), access Apple's system models with zero configuration:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "foundation", "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```
