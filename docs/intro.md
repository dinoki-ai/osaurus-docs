# Welcome to Osaurus

Osaurus is a **local-first AI runtime for Apple Silicon** — built for speed, simplicity, and privacy.

It lets you run state-of-the-art open-source models directly on your Mac with no cloud dependency, no gatekeepers, and no compromises.

## What is Osaurus?

At its core, Osaurus is:

- <Icon name="Zap" /> **Blazing fast** — optimized for M-series chips, written in Swift, and designed to feel seamless.
- <Icon name="Shield" /> **Private by default** — all inference runs on your machine, your data never leaves your device.
- <Icon name="Puzzle" /> **Open & flexible** — MIT-licensed, API-compatible with OpenAI and Ollama, and integrated with Apple's MLX ecosystem.
- <Icon name="Sliders" /> **Developer-friendly** — simple install, clean APIs, CLI + GUI for full control over your models.

Osaurus is lightweight (just ~7MB runtime footprint) yet powerful enough to support real-time interactivity.

## Why Osaurus?

Cloud-based AI is fast becoming expensive, restrictive, and privacy-challenging.

Osaurus flips the model:

- **Zero latency**: Local inference means faster, more responsive AI.
- **Total autonomy**: No enforced moderation or centralized limits.
- **Predictable costs**: No per-token billing — your hardware is the runtime.
- **Community-driven**: Open by design, extensible through plugins, models, and guides.

Osaurus is built for developers, creators, and teams who value control and speed.
